This program is a website that allows users to message therapists for treatment of mental health disorders. Users can sign up as one of two
types: therapists, and patients. Patients can only have one therapist, while therapists can treat multiple patients. There is, however,  a 
limit to the number of patients a therapist can treate. A therapist must specify the maximum number of patients they are willing to treat
when they sign up.

In order to get a therapist, a patient can send requests to therapists. If a therapist accepts the request, then the patient has the option 
of accepting or denying the request. This is so that, if multiple therapists accept a patient, the patient can choose which one to use. Ten 
randomly chosen therapists are presented to a patient when they sign up so that they can start requesting therapists right away. If they 
want to request a specific therapist, they can search for the therapist by name in their homepage. If a therapist is already treating their 
maximum number of patients, then they will not be able to take requests.
