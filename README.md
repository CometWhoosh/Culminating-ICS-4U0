# Mental Health Messaging Service

This program is a website that allows users to message therapists for treatment of mental health disorders. Users can sign up as one of two
types: therapists, and patients. Patients can only have one therapist, while therapists can treat multiple patients. There is, however,  a 
limit to the number of patients a therapist can treat. A therapist must specify the maximum number of patients they are willing to treat
when they sign up.

In order to be treated by a therapist, a patient can send requests to therapists. If a one accepts the request, then the patient has the option of accepting or denying the request. This is so that, if multiple therapists accept a patient, the patient can choose which one to use. Ten randomly chosen therapists are presented to a patient when they sign up so that they can start requesting therapists right away. If they want to request a specific therapist, they can search for the therapist by name in their homepage. If a therapist is already treating their maximum number of patients, then they will be unable to take requests.
